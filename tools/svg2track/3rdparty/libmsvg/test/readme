                        in the raw tree, convert to cooked and find again

tcook file.svg [utc] -> read the svg file, convert to cooked and serialize,
                        if "utc" (literal) is provided MsvgTransformCookedElement
                        is called for each serialized element

trbuild -> build a raw tree, write "msvgt2a.svg", duplicate the tree and
           write "msvgt2b.svg"
